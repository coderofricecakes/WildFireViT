Test Script:
Step by step instruction to implement and use the code

1.	Load the code “JosiahViTAttemptWildFire” into your preferred development platform. 
2.	Save the Archive folder somewhere on your computer or google collab
3.	Change the image directory in the Execution cell to where you saved the Archive folder. This is marked with the note “Change Archive Location”
4.	Change the location to save the model to somewhere on your computer or google drive. This can be found in the execution cell next to the note “Choose location to save model. 
5.	Afterwards you can start running the code. Make sure that you run the code starting from cell 1. 
6.	In cell 5 it is possible that Google Collab will ask you to access the Google Drive. If you have your archive and/or the model being saved to your google drive then you should allow that process to happen
7.	When cell 5 completes cell 6 will run. It will prompt the user to import an image. Import an image from the “SELECTED DATA SET” folder. The images from this folder have not been given to the model for training. 
8.	After importing the image you should get a message that will say “This looks like:” and then it will tell you what it is your imported.

Additional notes:
⁃	If you are training the model in google collab and you are not changing the number of epochs, expect it to take 5-6 hours to run. Do not let the tab disconnect from the internet nor let your computer turn off or go to sleep. If you do it is possible that you will need to start the training again.
